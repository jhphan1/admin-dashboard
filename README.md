This project was created using HTML and CSS. It was the culmination of learning intermediate CSS styling and, more specifically, CSS Grid. I found the project surprisingly challenging since I am much more used to Flexbox at this point. It seems less intuitive to align/justify items correctly with Grid. The Chrome Dev Tool that lets you choose the layout without memorizing syntax became my best friend. Overall, I'm happy with the final product's aesthetics and responsiveness to changes in screen size. I look forward to continuing to practice with CSS Grid.
